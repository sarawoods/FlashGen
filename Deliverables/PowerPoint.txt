Flash Card "Power Point Presentation"

Brendan
~ What was is our project?
> A Flash Card generator.


Remington
Save resources, go away from paper flash cards
~ What is the motivation behind this project?
> Current flash card generators are tedious.
> Have to type notes directly into the GUI.

Sara
Better version of microsoft powerpoint.
~ How is our generator better?
> Type up your notes as usual.
> Include special identifiers for questions(~), options(|), and answers(>).
> We parse it and make a GUI.


Oh no, this is in the wrong spot!!!
~ Conclusion: What did we learn?
> 



Brendan
~ What language did we use for the parser? Pick one.
| Haskell
| Python
| Java
| Prolog
> Haskell!

Remington
~ How did we create the GUI?
> Python library WXPython was used for GUI generation.

Sara
~ How did we get the parser (Haskell) and the GUI (Python) to communicate?
> Tried and failed to create a DLL. Haskell no longer outputs the correct files to create such a library.
> Ended up calling the Haskell program directly from the main Python program.
> Notecard information is passed as a JSON object.

~ What are some cool features of this project?
> We allow for shuffling of the cards. 
> You can also pick the order.
> To open a new text file with notes just go to "File/Open"
> The highlighting on the side corresponds to which flash card is being displayed.
