Flash Card "Power Point Presentation"


Brendan
~ What was our project?
> A Flash Card generator.
We are using this presentation to demonstrate the versatility of our application. Who needs powerpoint?




Remington
Save resources, go away from paper flash cards which are a pain to write out and carry around 
Many online flash card generators have an overwhelming amount of unnecessary options
Typing notes in class and then needing to retype them in a flash card generator is repetitive.  Most students would be too lazy to do this.
~ What is the motivation behind this project?
> Current flash card generators are tedious.
> Have to type notes directly into the GUI.


Sara
Better version of microsoft powerpoint.
.txt files are universally accepted, so these can be used across platforms
show this file as an example!
~ How is our generator better?
> Type up your notes as usual.
> Include special identifiers for questions(~), options(|), and answers(>).
> We parse it and make a GUI.


Remington
Oh no, this is in the wrong spot!!!
~ Conclusion: Do you have any questions?

Brendan
~ What language did we use for the parser? Pick one.
| Haskell
| Python
| Java
| Prolog
> Haskell!


Remington
~ How did we create the GUI?
> Python library WXPython was used for GUI generation.
Originally looked at other GUIs, but the buttons were very old looking and we wanted a fresh, appealing program design.
Main feature was adding preview pane on left side, used buttons to implement this so that left preview pane updates the right pane


Sara
~ How did we get the parser (Haskell) and the GUI (Python) to communicate?
> Tried and failed to create a DLL. Haskell no longer outputs the required files to create such a library.
> Ended up calling the Haskell program directly from the main Python program.
> Notecard information is passed as a JSON object.


Brendan
~ What are some cool features of this project?
> We allow for shuffling of the cards. 
> You can also pick the order.
> To open a new text file with notes just go to "File/Open"
> The highlighting on the side corresponds to which flash card is being displayed.
